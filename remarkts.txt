Hi Mike,

Thanks for submitting your app for review. You've done great work and I commend your efforts!

Overall, I have recommended that you make some improvements to your app before approval. You have a good foundation but there are too many small issues that add up to the current iteration not being suitable yet for a portfolio. I have marked the particularly important ones which in my opinion should be resolved before approval with a ‚ö†Ô∏è. All other notes are suggestions.

I've included detailed feedback and suggestions below, along with screenshots, which I hope will be helpful. 

Your screenshots and a more readable version of this feedback are available at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w4s1k1dxjuii1p5/AADSyMllROVxWiTACFE_Td9ta?dl=0. Please download them within one week, as I may remove them after that time.

If you'd like to discuss anything in more detail, you're welcome to get in touch with me via email at jharris@thinkful.com, or on Slack at @joshua_harris.

All the best,
üåø Joshua

# Concept & Content

The overall concept is clear and you have done a good job describing what the app does.

‚ö†Ô∏è There are several typos in the landing page copy. Recommend copy-editing.

# Responsiveness

‚ö†Ô∏è Neither the landing page nor the application respond on mobile devices. (1) This is mostly likely due to lack of a `viewport` meta tag.

# Design/UX

## Design/UX: Landing Page

- Main image is distorted vertically on all screen sizes. For instance, the clock is not circular. (1)
- Recommend removing the watermark from the main image if possible.
- Recommend centering the tagline.
- Recommend expanding your bullet-point list of features into feature sections. See https://simple.com for examples.
- Recommend changing "Dashboard" button text to something like "Get Started."
- Recommend changing cursor to pointer when hovering over buttons, such as the Dashboard button on the landing page, and other interactable elements on desktop browsers.
- Recommend removing the About and Sign Up links until they are implemented.

- Recommend following the conventional landing page structure of: 
	- Header with authentication buttons, 
	- Title and brief tagline against a full-screen image, 
	- Registration or Get Started button,
	- At least one feature section highlighting what your application does and how it is useful for your target audience. 
	- Examples:
		- [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com)
		- [InVision](https://invisionapp.com)
		- [Trello](https://trello.com)
		- [Simple](https://simple.com)

## Design/UX: Application

- Recommend making the "Add bunky" button more prominent (for instance, by adding a bright background color and rounded edges) since it is a primary action on the screen. It could also go in the main content area rather than the header.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Header styles disappear on the Add Bunky screen.
- Recommend adding additional spacing between header and first listing on dashboard.

# Functionality

- Navigation between screens currently triggers a page reload. Recommend refactoring the application into a Single-Page App to demonstrate modern development practices to potential employers.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Validation message on the Add Bunky screen displays "login or try a different email" even when the validation error has to do with another field - in this case, not having selected a Culture or having a password that is long enough. Recommend fine-tuning validation messages and displaying them closer to the fields that they apply to. (3)
- Recommend automatically directing a new user to the dashboard rather than making them click a Dashboard link.
- Recommend adding a confirmation prompt when deleting a Bunky.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Updating a Bunky has no default selections for the Budget, Roommates, or Culture fields so all must be reselected. Recommend preserving the current values for these fields. (4)
- User can remove previously required fields (name, email) from a Bunky during update. (5) 

## Functionality Tested

- ‚úÖ View Bunkies
- ‚úÖ Add a Bunky
- ‚úÖ Update a Bunky
- ‚úÖ Delete a Bunky
